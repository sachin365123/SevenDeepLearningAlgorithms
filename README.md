# SevenDeepLearningAlgorithms
Implementation of seven Deep Learning Algorithms on biomedical images Dataset, these algorithms are Model 1: EfficientNetB0, Model 2: Xception, Model 3: VGG16, Model 4: ResNet50, Model 5: MobileNet, Model 6: InceptionV3, Model 7: DenseNet121, Validation Loss: 0.46632832288742065 Validation Accuracy: 0.9233912229537964, also precision    recall  f1-score   support
A typical example of this kind of code is called classification. Here, I have chosen four classes namely Syst, Tumor, Stone and  no tumor.
